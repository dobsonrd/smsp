## Heading

The NHS Digital SMS interface provides a new interface to Spine based on the Spine Mini Services (SMS) specifications. It enables a simplified method for accessing demographic data on the Spine. It also provides access to Spine demographic data for non N3 connected systems such as those in Social Care or in other non NHS organisations. It fulfils the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) Provider requirements from the SMS architecture document set.
