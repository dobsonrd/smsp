## The SMSP Vision

The NHS Digital demographics ITK spine mini service specification was published a number of years ago; aimed at reducing technical integration complexity, whilst accessing a subset of demographics information without a smartcard, where only a single match is returned. Thus constraining the technical context, along with reducing the complexity of implementation and associated requirements.

## What is the Spine Core SMSP
* Provides an interface to simplify the technical integration into NHS Digital Personal Demographics Service (PDS)
* A lighter weight compliance process using the NHS Digital self-certified approach (Target Operating Model) to address clinical safety, operational readiness and Information Governance issues.
* Is constrained for use by suitable organisations with whom the NHS Digital has a legal basis for sharing

## What does Spine Mini Service Provider do?

The Spine Core SMSP provides the interface for a SMSP Client to directly query a subset of Spine services for demographic information.
