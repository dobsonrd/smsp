The SMSP MUST provide documentation that elaborates the message mapping from the SMSP API to the MIM messaging used to access National Applications in order for DHID to assure suitability. This must also take into account how these messages interact in the context of any caching that may be implemented (see SMSP-CACHE-002: Design documentation MUST consider caching).

There are many scenarios where a final outcome of one or more calls to PDS is that a business error is returned from PDS itself. This is important information to pass back to the SMSP client so that it has the opportunity to handle it appropriately and/or inform the user about the nature of the problem.<br />
Whilst the precise details of error handling and mapping are a responsibility of each supplier’s implementation, the following business error scenarios MUST be distinguishable by use of the appropriate SMSP error code:<br />

The NHS Number supplied as a parameter was matched with a record in PDS, but identified as an NHS number that has been superseded via a merge and is no longer a current valid NHS Number. However, a replacement (superseding) NHS number is available and is being returned. Error codes 17 or 44 are typical examples of two error codes which could have been returned by PDS in this scenario.</td>

<tr>
<td align="left" markdown="1">NHS Number Not Verified<br />
The NHS Number supplied exists on PDS and is still in use but the demographic data also supplied does not result in the correct degree of matching. Error code 40 is a typical example of one error code which could have been returned by PDS in this scenario.</td>
<td align="left" markdown="1">
DEMOG-0040

Note that with the examples given above there may also be another accompanying error code returned by PDS, as specified in the error base, and that the examples above are illustrative not exhaustive. Alternative mappings by suppliers may be considered. The examples given do not imply specific behaviour of the SMSP system.<br />
For business error scenarios returned by PDS other than those listed above then a generic code of DEMOG-9999 MAY be used as a default.<br />
NB: Validation errors detected by PDS are however a special case – see SMSP-ERR-006 for more about this.

<td align="left" markdown="1">Note 1</td>
<td align="left" markdown="1">
The SMSP client application may use wildcards in the tracing criteria. If wildcards are allowed, then the deploying organisation MUST review this as part of the clinical safety assessment of the application.<br />
Client applications using wildcards in tracing criteria, where a user and/or patient can confirm that the returned candidate PDS record is the correct one (known as an ‘attended’ scenario), present a lower risk of false-positive matches.<br />
A false-positive match is one where a single candidate PDS record is returned which meets the tracing criteria, but is not in fact the record being sought. User training in the confirmation of record matching will be required.<br />
Use of wildcards in other ‘non-attended’ tracing scenarios (i.e. where a user and/or patient is not present to confirm the possible match), is likely to increase the risk of false-positive matching of patients with inherent clinical implications. See guidance below for further details.<br />
Any organisation considering wildcard use must undertake a structured safety assessment of the clinical and governance risks involved.
Further guidance can be found on:<br />
