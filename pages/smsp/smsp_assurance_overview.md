There are two parties involved in a First of Type deployment:
- the system supplier (typically who developed the solution accessing SMSP)
- the deployming care organising actually using the service and accessing the demographics data



Two stages of assurance activity will occur:

- Technical Accreditation
This is the assurance of the software/product/service that makes use of the API.

- Solution Assurance
Solution assurance is carried out as part of deployment and vital to achieve a go-live with the APIs. This process ensures that the correct level of safety, governance, and security has been accepted, understood and signed off by the organisation using the APIs and data controllers of the records.
