## SMSP Reference Implementation
The ITK API provides a Java abstraction to the ITK transport and distribution mechanics. As such it aims to simplify the task of exchanging ITK based messages between applications whilst maintaining all of the benefits that the ITK “on the wire” specifications bring.

In addition to the the API the project also provides a reference implementation and set of examples scenarios that show how the API can be realised and used in real world uses. One such reference implementation is a client accessing spine mini services for demographics.
