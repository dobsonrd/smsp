## Details of the NHS Digital SMSP Test Environments

### Opentest (Non-N3 using VPN)
The Opentest system is a platform based on Spine 2 Core, to which healthcare applications developers can connect their systems. Unlike the formal "path-to-live" environments there are very few pre-conditions (you do not even have to have a working system yet). Environments based on the platform are hosted off the NHS "N3" network, therefore the Information Governance Statement of Conformance (IGSoC) is not required before use. 

More details on opentest and request access can be found here - [http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/ddc/oats/opentestinfo.pdf](http://systems.hscic.gov.uk/ddc/oats/opentestinfo.pdf)

### Path-to-Live Formal Development and Integration Enviroments (N3)
The formal path-to-live environments are hosted on N3 and as such the Information Governance Statement of Conformance (IGSoC) is required before use, as this is a predicate to connecting to N3.
