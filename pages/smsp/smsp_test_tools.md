## A summary of the NHS Digital SMSP test tools

### ITK Testbench
NHS Digital provides resources for interface development and those seeking assurane. One such resource is the Toolkit Workbench (TKW)
.
TKW contains two tools;
- TKW
- Autotest Manager.

**TKW** is command-line standalone test engine for message validation, message transmission, and ITK end point simulation.

**Autotest Manager** is a GUI driven fully automated test tool, which orchestrates the execution of multiple tests using TKW as the test engine. The Autotest Manager has recently been updated to include a ‘single run’ mode which effectively offers, via the GUI, the same functions as the TKW command line.
