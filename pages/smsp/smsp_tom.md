## SMSP Target Operating Model
The purpose of the Target Operating Model (TOM) is to inform and assist deploying organisation with the implementation of SMSP integrated systems within their local environment. In particular, it provides guidance on their responsibilities in terms of ensuring that their local systems do not compromise any core Spine Compliant systems to which they connect.

The TOM is currently presented in a form of a spreadsheet, with the work sheet broken into the logical assessment sections.

The TOM is typically used in two phases:
- Phase 1 the usage and settings information provided to NHS Digital for approval.
- Phase 2 the actual assessment phase contucted by the supplier and the deploying organisation.

Note: one an assessment has been performed by a supplier, the TOM will typically remain laregly unchanged (in terms of the risks/mitigations identified), and thus subsequent deployments will simply require the organisations details and and local context changes to the assessment.

{% include important.html content="An underlying theme of the Target Operating Model is “Responsibility”. The deploying organisations own and are responsible for both the systems and the data in their local environment.
In terms of accessing the NHS Digital SMSP, deploying organisations must ultimately take responsibility for discharging these obligations to assess the risks which exist within their local context. Any other centrally imposed approach stifles local innovation and is not scalable.
By defining a clear and documented assessment set (with associated guidelines and processes), the Target Operating Model provided the framework within which the local deploying organisaiton can discharge their obligations." %}
