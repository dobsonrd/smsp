## SMSP Target Operating Model
The purpose of the Target Operating Model (TOM) is to inform and assist deploying organisation with the implementation of SMSP integrated systems within their local environment. In particular, it provides an assessment framework of their responsibilities in terms of ensuring that their local systems meets the the technical, IG, Clinical safety, and functionality required for the business context.

The TOM is currently presented in a form of a spreadsheet, with the worksheet broken into the logical assessment sections.

The TOM is typically used in two phases:
- Phase 1 the usage and settings information provided to NHS Digital for approval.
- Phase 2 the actual assessment phase conducted by the supplier and the deploying organisation.

Note: once a complete assessment has been performed by a deploying Organisation and supplier, the TOM will typically remain largely unchanged (in terms of the risks/mitigations identified) for subsequent deployments, hence new deployments will simply require the new organisations details and any local context changes to the assessment.

{% include important.html content="An underlying theme of the Target Operating Model is “Responsibility”. The deploying organisations own and are responsible for both the systems and the data in their local environment.
In terms of accessing the NHS Digital SMSP, deploying organisations must ultimately take responsibility for discharging these obligations to assess the risks which exist within their local context. Any other centrally imposed approach stifles local innovation and is not scalable.
By defining a clear and documented assessment set (with associated guidelines and processes), the Target Operating Model provided the framework within which the local deploying organisation can discharge their obligations." %}
